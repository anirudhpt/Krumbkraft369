# Menu Database Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Successfully consolidated duplicate menu items in the Firestore `menu_items` database by implementing a new data structure that supports variants/options for menu items.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Data Structure
- Added `MenuItemOption` interface to support product variants
- Modified `MenuItem` interface to include optional `options` array
- Each option includes:
  - `name`: Option name (e.g., "Regular", "100% Whole Wheat")
  - `priceAdjustment`: Price difference from base price
  - `description`: Optional description of the option

### 2. Database Consolidations Applied

#### Olive & Rosemary Sourdough Bread
- **Before**: 2 separate items
  - "Olive and rosemary sourdough bread" ($275)
  - "100% Whole Wheat Olive Rosemary Sourdough Bread" ($325)
- **After**: 1 item with options
  - Base price: ₹275 (Regular)
  - 100% Whole Wheat option: +₹50 (total ₹325)

#### Cranberry & Walnut Sourdough Bread
- **Before**: 2 separate items
  - "Cranberry and walnut sourdough bread" ($290)
  - "100% Whole Wheat Cranberry & Walnut Sourdough Bread" ($325)
- **After**: 1 item with options
  - Base price: ₹290 (Regular)
  - 100% Whole Wheat option: +₹35 (total ₹325)

### 3. Updated Services and Components

#### MenuService Updates
- Added `deleteMenuItem()` method for removing duplicate items
- Added `consolidateDuplicates()` method for automated consolidation
- Imported `deleteDoc` from Firestore

#### MenuComponent Updates
- Created new `MenuItemCard` component to handle option selection
- Added radio button interface for choosing between options
- Dynamic price calculation based on selected option
- Visual indicators for price adjustments (+₹50, +₹35, etc.)
- Option descriptions display when available

### 4. Database Statistics
- **Before consolidation**: 40 items
- **After consolidation**: 38 items (2 duplicates removed)
- **Items with options**: 2 (Olive & Rosemary, Cranberry & Walnut breads)

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Menu**: Eliminated duplicate entries for similar products
2. **Better UX**: Customers can see all variants of a product in one place
3. **Flexible Pricing**: Easy to adjust prices for different variants
4. **Scalable**: Can easily add more options (e.g., sizes, additional ingredients)
5. **Consistent Naming**: Standardized product names

## Technical Implementation
- Used Firestore's `setDoc` with merge option to update existing items
- Used `deleteDoc` to remove duplicate items
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding new features
- Backward compatible with items that don't have options

## Future Considerations
Other potential consolidations could include:
- Pancake mixes (regular vs. buckwheat chocolate versions)
- Different sizes of the same product
- Seasonal variations of jams and spreads

The new structure is flexible enough to handle these future consolidations as needed.
